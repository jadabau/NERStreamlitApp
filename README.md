# üéì Notre Dame NER Explorer

Welcome to the **Notre Dame NER Explorer**: a custom-built Named Entity Recognition (NER) web app powered by **spaCy** and **Streamlit**, with the shamrock-studded Notre Dame spirit ‚òòÔ∏è

This app allows users to upload or paste their own text, define custom NER patterns, and visually explore highlighted entities in real-time using spaCy‚Äôs `EntityRuler`. Whether you're working with stories, campus history, or just experimenting with language, this tool makes entity recognition both easy, educational, and efficient.

## Project Overview

NER (Named Entity Recognition) is a key task in Natural Language Processing that identifies and classifies entities such as people, locations, organizations, and more. This app uses **spaCy**, a popular Python NLP library, to:

- Parse user-submitted text (typed or .txt file)
- Apply*custom rules through `EntityRuler`
- Visualize recognized entities with label-specific styling

I built this with **Streamlit** to create an intuitive interface with subtle accents of **Notre Dame navy, gold, and green**.
